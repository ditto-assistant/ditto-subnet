"""Locked API URL ↔ subtensor network pairs.

Each Ditto deployment binds an API server to exactly one subtensor
network at boot (see ``ditto.api_server.factory`` lifespan). Letting
the CLI override each side independently is therefore always a miner
footgun: a wrong-network upload either gets rejected at
``/upload/check`` (hotkey not registered on the API's chain) or sends
real TAO to the wrong chain entirely. Exposing one ``--network`` flag
backed by a lookup table is the smallest surface that cannot desync.

Network identifiers (``finney`` / ``test`` / ``local``) match the
bittensor SDK's canonical values verbatim (``bittensor.core.settings``
``NETWORKS = ['finney', 'test', 'archive', 'local', 'latent-lite']``)
and the btcli convention. ``finney`` is the mainnet identifier; the
colloquial "mainnet" word is not accepted by the SDK or btcli, and we
deliberately do not introduce a translation layer.

If a real decoupled deployment ever appears (staged rollout, canary
overrides), add override flags additively without breaking the existing
flag.

"""Canonical (API URL, subtensor network) pairs keyed by user-facing name.

``finney`` (mainnet) and ``test`` (testnet) API URLs are placeholders
until the API host is provisioned. The ``local`` entry points at the
local docker-compose stack used by integration tests and manual smoke;
the matching subtensor must be supplied by the developer (bittensor's
localnet workflow, not bundled in this repo). ``dev`` targets the
deployed dev platform (``platform-api-dev.heyditto.ai``); its chain is
the dev localnet, so pass ``--chain-endpoint`` with that node's ws
endpoint (``subtensor_network`` is ``local``, the raw endpoint is not
committed here).
