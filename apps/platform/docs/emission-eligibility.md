# Terminal-review emission eligibility

The operator gate that stops a scored artifact from earning emissions while its
own source review is unresolved, inconclusive, infrastructure-failed, or
escalated (ditto-subnet #2041, under epics #2051 and #2053).

**It ships off. Merging it cannot move emissions.** `enforcement` defaults to
`off`; with no revision stored the ledger is byte-for-byte what it was before,
the epoch pin's `ledger_digest` is unchanged, and nothing is written anywhere.

## The hole it closes

`list_eligible_ledger` filters the emission pool on `agents.status == 'scored'`,
which drops an agent parked in `ath_pending_review`. It does **not** drop what
[`ath-review-queue.md`](ath-review-queue.md) calls a **stranded hold**: an
`ath_reviews` row still `pending` while `agents.status` has moved back to
`scored`. At least three documented paths produce that state. Such a row is in
the ledger, folds into KOTH, and earns emissions with its review open. A later
rejection then makes the subnet's own past payments the dispute.

## Withheld states

One state per artifact, most specific first. Each is read from the table that
already owns it — nothing is duplicated into a new status column.

| `state` | Read from | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `review_rejected` | `ath_reviews.resolution = 'reject'` | Adjudicated against this artifact. Never eligible, never re-payable. |
| `review_escalated` | latest `ath_copy_court_recommendations.verdict = 'escalate'`, or `algorithm_provenance.review_kind = 'anomalous_score'` | The platform declined to decide mechanically; an operator must rule. |
| `review_inconclusive` | `reason_code` in `source-review-inconclusive`, `repeatedly-inconclusive` | Mandatory verification did not finish. **Not a finding** (#2077); the published reason says so. |
| `review_infrastructure_failed` | `reason_code` in `INFRA_AUTO_RETRY_REASON_CODES` + `PROVIDER_BACKOFF_REASON_CODES`, with a failed/expired latest attempt | Ditto's build, provider, or claim handling failed. **Never a miner violation** (#2051); retried automatically by `screening_infra_retry`. |
| `unresolved_review` | `ath_reviews.status = 'pending'`, any kind | The generic open hold, including a stranded one. |
| `review_missing` | no `passed` screening attempt | Only when the operator sets `require_completed_review` (off by default). |
| `awaiting_next_window` | `resolved_at >= window_start` on a `clear` | Cleared, and starting at the next window. |

`eligible` is everything else, including an artifact that was never held — which
is the overwhelming majority, and is why the default posture changes nothing.

Each withheld class has its own switch (`require_terminal_review`,
`exclude_inconclusive`, `exclude_infrastructure_failed`, `exclude_escalated`,
`require_completed_review`), so a class can be enabled or disabled on its own.

## The next-window rule

Eligibility is evaluated against a **tumbling UTC window** whose length is
`activation_window_seconds` (default 3600, the validator epoch). A terminal
clear at `t` is honoured from the first window opening strictly after `t`.

Two reasons, and neither is negotiable:

* A clear applied mid-window would move the fold's pool under validators that
  already read it — the split `ledger_pin` exists to remove.
* Honouring it any earlier than the boundary would be a retroactive grant.

**There is no back-pay and no clawback.** The only thing the gate can do is
include or exclude a row from the *next* fold. `activates_at` on the eligibility
record says when a cleared artifact starts earning; nothing anywhere describes
the withheld period as owed, because no field exists to put that in.

## What miners see

Scores stay published throughout. Three separate facts:

* **score rank** — `PublicLeaderboardEntry.rank`, unchanged. A withheld leader
  still leads.
* **provisional champion** — `PublicKothEmissions.provisional_champion` /
  `champion_reward_eligible`. A champion whose artifact is withheld keeps the
  crown and the 65% slot goes *unpaid*, not reassigned (see
  [Holding the crown unpaid](#holding-the-crown-unpaid)). The recipient row
  carries `paid: false` and keeps its `share_of_miner_pool`, so the unpaid
  share stays visible as a fraction of the whole miner pool.
* **reward eligibility** — `PublicLeaderboardEntry.reward_eligibility` and
  `PublicSubmissionPipeline.reward_eligibility`: the state, a fixed
  miner-facing sentence, `reward_eligible`, `posture_satisfied`, the posture
  revision, the window, and `activates_at`.

The sentences come from one table (`STATE_REASONS`), so the board, the
submission page and Backroom cannot disagree. They carry no source, no reviewer
output, no thresholds and no cohort statistics.

## Holding the crown unpaid

Withholding a row must not hand its crown to someone else. Under crown
incumbency (`crown_mode: incumbent`, epoch pins only) the pin resolves the
previous champion through its owner family among the payable entries, as it
always has. When that finds nothing, the gate is enforcing, and the owner has a
withheld generation, the owner's best withheld generation becomes the pin's
**provisional incumbent**:

* It is served as `LedgerResponse.provisional_incumbent`, *not* in `entries`,
  with `crown_incumbent_agent_id` set to its id. It is built exactly like a
  payable entry (the one it would carry with the gate off) and it is part of
  the pin's digest.
* The fold -- the validator's, and the Platform's projections of it -- adds it
  to the pool as the crown incumbent and derives the champion, tail, tie
  pooling and score-ceiling cohort exactly as for any entry. **Every share it
  is allocated is then unpaid**: validators burn it rather than renormalize it
  onto other miners, so everybody else keeps exactly the share they would hold
  had it been paid.
* If it keeps the crown, the champion slot is unpaid. If a challenger clears
  the band over it, the challenger is crowned and paid as usual and a tail slot
  it lands in is unpaid. The pin records whoever holds the crown, so a
  provisional champion carries its crown into the next pin.
* Only the incumbent can be provisional. Every other withheld row stays out of
  the pool, and an owner whose newest generation is withheld is still
  represented by its best payable generation.

Only a protocol-28 validator reads the field; a protocol-27 validator would
ignore it and crown and pay the runner-up. So `enforce` withholds only while
every recently-live weight-setting validator reports protocol 28
(`PROVISIONAL_INCUMBENT_PROTOCOL`). Until then it behaves exactly like
`shadow`: every read evaluates the gate and records rehearsal rows (with
`enforcement: shadow`), nothing leaves the pool, no marker is served, and each
materialization logs a warning. The readiness is recorded on every pin
(`context.fleet.reward_eligibility`) and shown on the policy read as
`effective.effective_enforcement`, `fleet_protocol_ready` and
`required_protocol`.

## Rehearsing, then enabling

```
off  ->  shadow  ->  enforce
```

1. **Rehearse.** Write a `shadow` revision. Every ledger read now evaluates the
   gate and appends one `emission_eligibility_shadow_records` row per artifact
   per window for what `enforce` *would* have withheld — while the pool keeps
   paying exactly as before. Read it back on
   `GET /api/v1/admin/emission-eligibility` (`recent_shadow_records`,
   `effective.shadow_excluded_count`) or in Backroom
   (`get_emission_eligibility_policy`). Per artifact:
   `GET /api/v1/admin/agents/{agent_id}/emission-eligibility`, Backroom
   `get_agent_emission_eligibility`.
2. **Reconcile.** Every row in that rehearsal is a miner who stops earning at
   the flip. Clear or reject the holds first; a stranded hold needs unsticking
   before it can be resolved at all (see `ath-review-queue.md`).
3. **Enable.** Write an `enforce` revision. Once the fleet reports protocol 28
   (`effective_enforcement: enforce`), withheld rows leave the pool at the
   platform's next materialization, and at the next pin for the pinned fleet.

Writes are `POST /api/v1/admin/emission-eligibility` with `expected_revision`,
an `actor`, a `reason` of at least eight characters, and the confirmation
`APPLY EMISSION ELIGIBILITY` typed verbatim. Revisions are append-only.

## Failure directions

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| No revision stored | `off`. Pre-gate ledger. |
| `enforce` stored, fleet below protocol 28 | Rehearses as `shadow`, logged. **Keeps paying.** |
| Revision will not parse | `off`, logged, `source: "default"` with the unusable `revision` still reported so it is findable. **Keeps paying.** |
| Review tables unreadable on the board / submission page | No annotation; the page renders. The validator ledger resolves independently. |
| Rehearsal insert fails | Logged and swallowed. Losing a rehearsal row is an observability loss; failing the ledger read would zero every miner. |
| Ledger read fails and the last-known-good snapshot is served | The posture marker is replayed with the entries it filtered, never re-resolved. |

Every direction is the same one: an error never withholds.

## Wire and storage

* `LedgerResponse.reward_eligibility_mode` — `"enforce"` or absent. Additive and
  optional, keyed into the pin's `served` context **only** when enforcing, so
  every pin taken off or in shadow keeps its pre-#2041 digest. The pool is
  filtered platform-side either way, so a validator that ignores the field folds
  correctly.
* `LedgerResponse.provisional_incumbent` — protocol 28, a `LedgerEntry` or
  absent. Keyed into the pin's `served` context **only** when present, so every
  pin without one keeps its digest; never served on a live read.
* The pin stores its review eligibility records and effective enforcement in
  its internal context. Public row annotations and operator reads use those
  frozen decisions until the next pin, so a same-epoch review or settings
  change cannot claim the current validator fold has already adopted it. The
  board's emissions section still projects the next pin using current policy.
  The records do not change the validator digest because they are explanatory,
  not fold inputs.
* `PublicEmissionRecipient.paid` / `PublicLedgerEpochRecipient.paid` — present,
  and `false`, only on a provisional incumbent's slot.
* `emission_eligibility_settings_revisions` — append-only posture, shaped like
  `burn_settings_revisions`.
* `emission_eligibility_shadow_records` — append-only rehearsal, unique on
  `(agent_id, bench_version, policy_revision, window_start)` so a 30-second
  validator poll cannot grow it.
